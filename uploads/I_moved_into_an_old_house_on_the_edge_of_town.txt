I moved into an old house on the edge of town. It was cheap… too cheap… but the price was the only thing that made sense about it. The first few nights were peaceful, aside from the usual creaks and groans of an aging structure. But then I started hearing the whispers.
At first, I thought it was the house settling, the wind, maybe even my own imagination. But as the days passed, the whispers grew louder. They seemed to come from the walls, behind the plaster, the pipes. They weren’t words, just soft, unintelligible murmurs. It was like someone was speaking right beside me, but when I’d check, no one would be there.
I tried to ignore it. But it got worse. I began hearing footsteps in the middle of the night, slow and deliberate, pacing back and forth in the hall. Sometimes, I’d hear a knock on the door, but no one would be there when I opened it. I started sleeping with the lights on, but that didn’t help. The voices were always there, like a constant hum in the background.
One night, I decided to confront it. Armed with a flashlight, I began investigating the walls, tapping on them, hoping to find some rational explanation. That’s when I found it… a small, hidden door behind a bookshelf in the living room. It was old, almost as if it had been forgotten for years.
I hesitated, but curiosity got the better of me. I pried the door open. The room was tiny, barely large enough to crawl in, but it was filled with old, rotting furniture and strange symbols painted on the walls. And there, in the center of the room, was a small, broken mirror.
As I stepped closer, the whispers turned into clear voices pleading, crying, begging for help. And in the mirror, I saw something I’ll never forget myself, but twisted, distorted, like a reflection of something... wrong. The thing in the mirror smiled at me, a grotesque grin, and whispered one last phrase: "You should never have opened the door."
I slammed it shut and ran, but the whispers didn’t stop. They’ve been getting louder ever since. Now, I hear them even when I’m outside, when I’m at work, in my car. They’re in my head. I can’t escape them.
And sometimes, late at night, I swear I see something in the corner of my eye, waiting for me to open that door again.
